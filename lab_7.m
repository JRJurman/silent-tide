%% Step 1
% Calculate the color error of the display model
%%
% <include>color_error_display.m</include>
%%
% <include>color_error_display_reading.m</include>
%%
% <<../error_sheet/calibrated_workflow_error.png>>
% 
%% Step 2
%  evaluating the color error of an uncalibrated color imaging workflow
%%
% <include>colorError_uncalibrated.m</include>
%%
% <include>color_uncal_reading.m</include>
%%
% <<../error_sheet/uncalibrated_workflow_error.png>>
%
%% Step 3
%  evaluating the color error of an calibrated color imaging workflow
%%
% <include>colorError_calibrated.m</include>
%%
% <include>color_calibrated_reading.m</include>
%%
% <<../error_sheet/calibrated_workflow_error.png>>
%
%% Step 4
% Comparing the calibrated workflow against the uncalibrated workflow.
% As can be seen, the uncalibrated workflow produced less error.
%%
% <<../error_sheet/cal_vs_uncal.png>>
%
%% Step 5 & 6
% Review the models and making adjustments to improve the image
% We believed our display model was the cause of a lot of our error, and
% tried to improve it, with little results
%%
% <<../error_sheet/full_sheet.png>>
%% Step 7
% The images as displayed on the monitor, uncalibrated, and then calibrated

%% Step 8
% The lab in and of itself was not difficult, but it did require using the
% colorMunki over and over again every time we tried to improve our data.
% We had trouble with Lab 6 and it really compounded when we tried to
% improve our dEab here.
